    "Criteria for Choosing the Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Relevance to App: This dataset contains information that will build a perfect framework for my interactive app. My goal is to create an app that gives users movie recommendations based on their preferences (genre, actors, etc.). This dataset contains all of that information as well as ratings, which will help to curate these recommendations. Further, I would like to compare movies of the same genre, films that were in theatres around the same time, etc. on my website in an interactive way, so this dataset provides me with all of the information I need in order to achieve this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Data Completeness: This dataset is relatively complete, as there are very few cells missing key information. Because we have information available on genre, actors, year released, etc. for the vast majority of films, we will be able to provide the user with a great deal of information for any movie recommended to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Data Quality: This dataset was fairly clean from the start; I removed a few columns that were not relevant to my app, but the data is consistent and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Diversity in Categories: This data encompasses a wide variety of films, whether that be within specific genres, time periods, or in the country of origin. This was ideal because it ensures that the user's preferences will be met with matches regardless of how niche of a category they may be looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Reliability: This data is sourced from FilmTV, which is a credile, reliable source that utilizes the same standardized rating systems as other sites such as Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb. Because these rating metrics are widely accepted, it contributes to a positive user experience as far as interpreting the information given."

Each row represents a movie available on FilmTV (there are over 40,000 movies). The columns include the movie title, year of release, duration, country, directors, actors, and ratings. "

By making the various elements easy to navigate, providing lots of options for filtering, and providing recommendations that cater to the individual interests of the users, I hope to make an app that is enjoyable to navigate. I will make the search features (search bar, filters, etc.) intuitive and require few steps to avoid frustration. Further, I will use visually-appealing interactive features to captivate users who may be more interested in the statistical aspect of the app than the recommendation feature. In other words, by providing a mix of interactive components, I hope to cater to the varied interests and needs of the user to create a more personal feel to the experience."

This gives an interesting visual for the relationship between actors, ratings, and their overall contribution to the film industry. Note: this same concept could be applied to directors. \n",

    "-Boxplot of Ratings by Genre: Create boxplots comparing the distribution of ratings across different movie genres in the same period of time.

This could also be done the other way, where we reate boxplots comparing the distribution of ratings of a specific genre across different periods of time. For example, boxplots displaying the distribution of ratings of horror movies released in different time periods.\n",

The same concept could be applied to actor-director collaborations. Another way to visualize this infomration could be in a network graph."
